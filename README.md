🌍 TripNext

TripNext is a travel accommodation platform built to help users explore different hostel listings through category-based search and price-based filtering. The application emphasizes simplicity, usability, and performance, allowing users to quickly find accommodations that match their preferences and budget.

The user interface is fully developed with a clean and modern design that works smoothly on both mobile phones and desktop screens. Responsive layouts, consistent styling, and intuitive navigation ensure that users can browse listings, view hostel details, and move across pages effortlessly regardless of device size. Careful attention has been given to layout structure, spacing, and typography to deliver a pleasant and accessible browsing experience.

Users can explore hostel listings in an organized manner, apply filters to narrow down results, and view detailed information for each hostel, including pricing and category details. The interface is optimized for clarity and ease of use, making the platform suitable for both first-time and returning users.

The backend is currently under active development and will be completed soon. It is designed to support secure user authentication with login and signup functionality and full integration with MongoDB for reliable data storage. The system will allow any authenticated user to add new hostel listings, while admin users will have permissions to edit or delete listings, ensuring proper moderation and data consistency.

TripNext follows a structured and scalable approach, focusing on real-world development practices such as authentication, role-based access control, database integration, and maintainable architecture.
