🌍 TripNext

TripNext is a travel accommodation platform that helps users discover hostel listings using category-based search and price filters. The goal of the project is to make finding suitable stays simple, fast, and user-friendly, especially for travelers who want quick and relevant results.

The user interface is fully ready and designed with a clean, modern look that works smoothly on both mobile phones and desktop devices. The layout is responsive, navigation is straightforward, and the overall design focuses on ease of use so users can browse listings and view hostel details without any hassle. Attention has been paid to spacing, typography, and consistency to create a comfortable browsing experience across all screen sizes.

Users can explore hostels in an organized way, apply filters to narrow down options, and view clear details such as pricing and categories. The interface is simple yet effective, making it easy for both new users and regular visitors to find what they’re looking for.

The backend is currently under development and will be completed soon. It will include secure login and signup functionality and full MongoDB integration for storing user and hostel data. Any authenticated user will be able to add new hostel listings, while admin users will have the ability to edit or delete listings, helping keep the platform accurate and well-maintained.

TripNext is being built with scalability and real-world use in mind, following standard development practices like authentication, role-based access control, database integration, and clean, maintainable code.
